          <p><b><u>TAKE A SMART MOVE TO GO AHEAD AS A LEADER.</u></b></p>
          <p>Indian industry is under a tremendous pressure from global competition. Profit margins have vanished in thin air as market forces decide selling prices, whereas input prices are exponentially increasing. Cost cutting is the key to survival. </p>
          <p>In todayâ€™s world the simplest way of cost cutting is to introduce new technology, increase the production within time with minimum manpower requirement. But this is not always possible with small or medium type of industries. Even not for the bigger size due to cut-throat competition. Hence we suggest to go with the taking an advantage of law of conservation. Our ancients were rightly said that use as much as you require but do not waste. </p>
          <p>We are concentrating on the essential part of any industry for conservation and that is energy. That might be in the form of electricity or thermal energy. No such industry can develop its base without any one of this energy and hence there is always possibility of wastage and conservation opportunity in the energy. </p>
